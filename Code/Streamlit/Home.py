organization, event, or product. In other words, it is one measure of the impact their activities are having 
on the environment, and how much they are contributing to climate change. 
It‚Äôs measured in kilograms of CO‚ÇÇ per week (kg/week) in this app.""")

organization, such as fuel combustion in vehicles and energy use in buildings. 
- **Indirect Emissions:** Emissions resulting from the production and transportation of goods and 
services used, including:  
- **Supply Chain Emissions:** Emissions produced during the extraction, processing, and 
transportation of raw materials. 
- **Waste Management:** Emissions generated from the disposal or treatment of waste.""")
