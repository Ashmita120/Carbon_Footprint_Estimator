## üß† What is a Carbon Footprint?

A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. It is typically measured in kilograms or tons of CO‚ÇÇ equivalent (kg CO‚ÇÇe).


## üõë Major Sources of Carbon Emissions

1. **Transportation** ‚Äì Cars, flights, public transport.
2. **Diet** ‚Äì Consumption of meat, dairy, or plant-based food.
3. **Electricity & Energy Use** ‚Äì From non-renewable sources.
4. **Goods and Services** ‚Äì Manufacturing, shopping, packaging, etc.

**Total Emissions Calculation Formula:** (1) + (2) + (3) + (4) + (5) + (6) + (7) + (8) kg/week

The machine learning models learn from past patterns and predict future CO‚ÇÇ output.


## üìÅ Dataset Used
- Carbon_Emission_Data.csv - KAGGLE

## üìä Approach Used

**1. Data Understanding & Cleaning:** 
- Analyzed the carbon emission dataset and selected relevant features related to electricity use, transportation, diet, waste generation, and fuel usage.

- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder for consistent model input.

**2. Feature Selection:**

- Chose core lifestyle indicators for model training that strongly impact personal emissions:

- Diet, Heating Source, Transport, Grocery Bill, Air Travel Frequency, Vehicle Distance, Waste Bag Count, Electricity Usage

**3. Model Building:**

- Trained three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

- Evaluated each using MSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score, and selected the best-performing model by considering the lowest MSE.

- Saved the final model using joblib for reuse in Streamlit.

**4. Model Explainability:**

- Visualized feature correlations using heatmaps.
-  Actual vs Predicted Plot

**5. User Interface (Streamlit):**

- Developed a multi-page web app.

- Home Page introduces carbon footprint concepts and sources.

- Calculator Page allows users to enter lifestyle inputs and receive:

- Estimated CO‚ÇÇ footprint

- Predictions: low, moderate, or high

- Suggestions to reduce emissions.

## ‚úÖ How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint

| Action                          | Estimated Reduction (kg/week) |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Switch to plant-based diet      | ~10‚Äì20 kg                     |
| Use public transport or bike    | ~30 kg                        |
| Reduce electricity consumption  | ~10‚Äì50 kg                     |
| Avoid flights                   | ~100‚Äì200 kg per trip          |


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in reducing carbon footprint

- **1. Lack of Awareness:** Many individuals and even organizations are unaware of the extent of their carbon footprint or what activities contribute most to it.
- **2. Economic Constraints:** Switching to eco-friendly alternatives (e.g., electric vehicles, solar panels, energy-efficient appliances) often requires high upfront costs, which can be a barrier for many households and businesses.
- **3. Limited Access to Alternatives:** In some regions, sustainable options like public transport, organic food, or renewable energy may not be available or practical.
- **4. Behavioral Inertia:** People tend to stick to habitual lifestyles. Changing dietary habits, daily commuting, or purchasing decisions takes time, motivation, and education.
- **5. Policy and Regulation Gaps:** In many countries, government incentives, regulations, or penalties related to carbon emissions are either weak or poorly enforced..


## üß† Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can estimate an individual's carbon footprint based on key lifestyle indicators. The model can be integrated into sustainability dashboards, mobile apps, or used for awareness campaigns.
